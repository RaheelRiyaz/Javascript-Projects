      <p class="about-me">
        I'm a 20 year old developer living in Germany. I discovered my passion
        for coding in 2019 when I saw my brother doing it. I fell in love with
        using my creativity to build things for the web. I decided to drop out
        of high school and pursue a coding career, facing challenges along the
        way. Through persistence, self-discipline, and commitment, I achieved my
        goal of becoming a fullstack developer. What kept me on this journey is
        that I always find learning new things exciting and facing unfamiliar
        challenges. In addition to coding, I enjoy building side projects
        because it allows me to explore my creativity and accomplish exciting
        things.
